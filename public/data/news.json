      "description": "Thirteen of the world’s top 20 most polluted cities are in India, with Byrnihat in Assam topping the list, according to a new report published on Tuesday. The World Air Quality Report 2024 by Swiss air quality technology company IQAir said Delhi remains the most polluted capital city globally, while India ranked as the world’s fifth most polluted country in 2024, down from third in 2023. Four cities in neighbouring Pakistan and one in China are among the world’s top 20 polluted cities. The high level of pollution in Byrnihat, a town on the border of Assam and Meghalaya, is due to emissions from local factories, including distilleries, iron and steel plants. Delhi grapples with high air pollution year-round and the problem worsens in winter when unfavourable meteorological conditions, combined with vehicular emissions, paddy-straw burning, firecrackers and other local pollution sources, make the air quality hazardous. Air pollution remains a serious health risk in India, reducing life expectancy by an estimated 5.2 years. According to a Lancet Planetary Health study published last year, about 1.5 million deaths in India every year from 2009 to 2019 were potentially linked to long-term exposure to PM2.5 pollution.",
